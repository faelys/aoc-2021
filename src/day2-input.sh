# Example usage: ./day2-input.sh $(wc -l day2-input.txt) <day2-input.txt >day2b-dyn.cex

# This script converts Advent of Code input into an XML counter-example.
# It relies on the following mapping (from day2b-dyn.map)
#   dir : {s3,s4,-}
#   amount : {s5,s6,s7,s8,-}
# And the following order of values for the direction:
#   enum { finished, forward, up, down }
#   /*        0         1     2    3       */
