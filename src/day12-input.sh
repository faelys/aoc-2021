# This scripts converts a sequence of bits into an XML counter-example.
# The input format is one stream per column and one line per time step,
# With 1 and 0 being converted into boolean f and t respectively.
# The input text should be limited to [-10tf ], and a column consisting only
# of spaces removes the stream from the output. A space in a column with
# other characters desynchronizes the variables, which might not be
# what you want.
