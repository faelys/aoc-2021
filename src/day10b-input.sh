# This scripts converts a sequence of bits into an XML counter-example.
# The input format is one stream per column and one line per time step,
# With 1 and 0 being converted into boolean f and t respectively.
# The input text should be limited to [-10tf ], and a column consisting only
# of spaces removes the stream from the output. A space in a column with
# other characters desynchronizes the variables, which might not be
# what you want.

# Usage: ./day10b-input.sh $(wc -c <day10.txt) <day10.txt >day10b.cex
# Generate an XML counter-example file matching read_char in day10b.hll
# Beware that this time it's `wc -c`, i.e. as many time steps as bytes
# in the input files.
