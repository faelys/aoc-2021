Thanks to [Balise][1], I was tempted to try the [Advent of Code this
year (2021)][2].

The language I was the most tempted to explore is [HLL][3], which is used
in my workplace to formally validate safety properties in industrial
settings.

I have been allowed to use [my employer's tools][4] to retrieve answers
from the HLL sources, but the lack of availability of such tools might make
this repository less interesting.

Still, I welcome all advice and comments on my HLL code (I'm still
learning!), as well as all question about it or the environment in general
(industrial formal methods are really interesting, and I won't betray any
industrial secret).
